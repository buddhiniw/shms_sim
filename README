SHMS_simulation for fringe fields - test code
=================================================
This is a code used for testing the shms_sim code using $GEANT4/examples/extended/analysis/AnaEx01. 
To run, first copy the example into the working directory. 
Modify the Vaccum, Lead and Liquid Argon material definitions to match what is on the AnaEx01.gdml. The changes should be made in the DetectorConstruction.cc file under $GEANT4/examples/extended/analysis/share folder.


Make sure to source buddhini.csh at the login and $G4BIN/geant4.csh to set the GEANT4 enviorenment

To run this simulation -

 - mkdir shms_sim_build
 - cd shms_sim_build
 - cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/net/cdaq/cdaql3data/cdaq/geant4 9.6.2 ~/geant4work/examples/advanced/shms_simulation

- Then compile
make -j  3

and

./shms_sim AnEx01.gdml
